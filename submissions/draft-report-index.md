## Notes

- File existence is checked by this script; content quality still needs human review.
- `external/xv6-riscv/` is intentionally not listed as a tracked submission artifact.
- xv6 baseline make, boot evidence, lab1 patched make, hello output, add2 output, pstatetest output, pcounttest output, pchildtest output, and integrated sequence evidence are summarized in docs/04_test_report.md.
- lab1 now has two patch levels: 0001 hello minimal syscall and 0002 add2 argint extension.
- lab2 has an independent pstate process observation patch from clean baseline.
- integrated-labs provides the verified comprehensive demo sequence with hello=22, add2=23, pstate=24, pcount=25.
- The child-state demo command is pchildtest; the longer pstatechildtest name is not used because xv6 DIRSIZ caused a real mkfs failure.
- scripts/xv6/apply-integrated-labs.sh is the recommended helper for final integrated demo reproduction.
- Technical report v0.1 and reproducibility package are drafts for review, not final submission files.
- Raw logs remain ignored by Git; do not submit logs/*.log.
- QEMU long-running stability and manual interactive shell testing remain TODO.
