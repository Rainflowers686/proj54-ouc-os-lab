# Initial Submission Material Index Draft

Generated time: TODO: fill manually before final submission

This file is generated or updated by `scripts/collect-report.sh`.
It is not the final technical report, does not generate PDF, and does not include registration materials, private data, or fabricated results.

## Notes

- File existence is checked by this script; content quality still needs human review.
- `external/xv6-riscv/` is intentionally not listed as a tracked submission artifact.
- xv6 baseline make, boot evidence, lab1 patched make, hello output, and add2 output are summarized in docs/04_test_report.md.
- lab1 now has two patch levels: 0001 hello minimal syscall and 0002 add2 argint extension.
- Technical report v0.1 and reproducibility package are drafts for review, not final submission files.
- Raw logs remain ignored by Git; do not submit logs/*.log.
- QEMU long-running stability and manual interactive shell testing remain TODO.
