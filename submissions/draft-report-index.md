# Initial Submission Material Index Draft

Generated time: TODO: fill manually before final submission

This file is generated or updated by `scripts/collect-report.sh`.
It is not the final technical report, does not generate PDF, and does not include registration materials, private data, or fabricated results.

## Material Index

## Notes

- File existence is checked by this script; content quality still needs human review.
- `external/xv6-riscv/` is intentionally not listed as a tracked submission artifact.
- xv6 baseline make, hardened boot evidence retry, lab1 patched make, hello output, add2 output, pstatetest output, pcounttest output, pchildtest output, fcounttest output, and integrated sequence evidence are summarized in docs/04_test_report.md.
- lab1 now has two patch levels: 0001 hello minimal syscall and 0002 add2 argint extension.
- lab2 has an independent pstate process observation patch from clean baseline.
- lab3 has an independent pgcount patch, integrated 0006 pgcount, and an independent memstat patch also integrated as 0008; e8e2fb9 0001-0007 full verification by lead/root/z2996 is a historical stable checkpoint in submissions/evidence_manifest.md, and the 0001-0009 re-verification is TBD.
- integrated-labs provides the verified comprehensive demo sequence with hello=22, add2=23, pstate=24, pcount=25, fcount=26, pgcount=27, fdcount=28, memstat=29, fdinfo=30.
- The child-state demo command is pchildtest; the longer pstatechildtest name is not used because xv6 DIRSIZ caused a real mkfs failure.
- scripts/xv6/apply-integrated-labs.sh is the recommended helper for final integrated demo reproduction and now applies integrated 0001-0009.
- scripts/xv6/doctor.sh is the read-only environment diagnosis entry and does not run make/QEMU.
- scripts/xv6/teammate-verify.sh --full is the recommended first teammate workflow; --quick is for retesting after make already succeeded.
- scripts/xv6/local-verify.sh --quick is recommended for team-lead pre-recording checks.
- scripts/xv6/cleanup-qemu.sh is the rescue command when QEMU is stuck or Ctrl+Z suspended a job.
- stage12 reorganized the repo learner-first: README and docs/README route students/teachers/judges separately; every lab has a tutorial README plus a student_tasks.md assignment sheet; teacher_guide/grading_and_rubric/troubleshooting support running this as a course; submission evidence stays rigorous under submissions/ and docs/final/.
- scripts/check-final-hygiene.sh and scripts/check-evidence-sha256.sh are the stage12 pre-submission gates; evidence hashes are verified in place outside Git and TBD 0001-0009 evidence is never faked.
- stage13 added scripts/labctl.sh (single course entry + per-lab test matrix), scripts/grade-summaries.sh (TA batch acceptance aid, not a grader), and scripts/check-docs-consistency.sh (mechanical drift gate); all three delegate to or check existing assets instead of reimplementing verification.
- docs/final/ is the formal submission documentation portal for stage8a and should be the basis for technical report v1.0 and PPT.
- docs/README.md explains the boundary between formal docs/final documentation and historical process records.
- Technical report v1.0 draft is docs/final/technical_report_v1.0.md; technical report v0.1 is historical only.
- Final PPT source is slides/final_ppt.md and current PPTX output is slides/final_defense_ppt.pptx; final human review and rehearsal are still required.
- docs/13_technical_report_v0.1.md is explicitly marked as a historical draft superseded by docs/final and a future technical report v1.0.
- Raw logs remain ignored by Git; do not submit logs/*.log.
- boot-xv6.sh now defaults to 45s soft timeout, hard timeout max(timeout+15,75), and 2 attempts; QEMU long-running stability and manual interactive shell testing remain TODO.
- run-xv6-command.sh now defaults to 60s soft timeout, hard timeout max(timeout+15,75), and 2 attempts; success is still based only on real log matching.
- apply-integrated-labs.sh --make --yes uses XV6_MAKE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, default 600 seconds; make success is never fabricated.
- Teammate QEMU cleanup troubleshooting is documented in docs/22_teammate_reproduction_troubleshooting.md.
- Plain-language teammate quickstart is documented in docs/23_teammate_quickstart.md; teammates should copy the COPY THIS SUMMARY TO TEAM LEAD block to the team lead.
- Video files are not committed; final and historical video metadata plus SHA256 are recorded in submissions/demo_record.md.
- e8e2fb9 lead/root/z2996 full PASS (integrated 0001-0007) is recorded as a historical stable checkpoint in submissions/teammate_reproduction_record.md; the stage11b integrated suite is 0001-0009 and its teammate re-verification is TBD; old 1ba9db6 records remain historical evidence only.
- submissions/evidence_manifest.md is the central final evidence index and does not store raw evidence files.
