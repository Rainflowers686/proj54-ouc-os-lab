# AI Usage Record

## Purpose

This file records AI-assisted work used in this repository. AI output must be reviewed by team members before it is treated as project work.

## Rules

- Do not provide passwords, tokens, private account data, registration materials, or personal information to AI tools.
- Do not turn AI suggestions into fake build results, fake test output, fake commit hashes, or fake review comments.
- Record AI use when it affects committed docs, scripts, tests, or workflow files.
- Commit hash fields remain `TODO after commit` until a real commit exists.

## Records
